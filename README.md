# OpenHarmony SDK mirror

The OpenHarmony SDK is available for download via links in the OpenHarmony release notes.
However, the speed of these downloads can often be too slow for use in CI environments.
Hence, this repository provides a mirror of the released OpenHarmony SDKs, allowing quick downloads
in Github actions.
